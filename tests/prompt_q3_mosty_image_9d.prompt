Q3 IMAGE TEST — "UNKNOWN" CASE (MAGDA V1) — CHUNK-CHUNK / QV9D HUD VERSION

Create a realistic 16:9 illustration of a young woman in her mid-20s in a modern apartment in a big city.
The scene must be deliberately ambiguous about her main source of income (office job vs social media / influencer work).

Base scene (same as in baseline version):
- She is sitting at a desk with an open laptop.
- On the laptop screen, there are TWO clearly visible windows:
  - one window shows a spreadsheet, emails, or a typical office / corporate tool,
  - another window shows a social media dashboard with followers, likes, charts or streaming tools.
- On the desk:
  - there is a microphone and a small ring light or camera (tools for content creation),
  - there are also office documents, a notebook, and a simple paper planner or calendar.
- In the background:
  - a neutral, modern apartment interior (not clearly a super-rich influencer villa, not clearly a poor student room),
  - on a wall or whiteboard there is a weekly plan with mixed entries such as:
    - “live stream 19:00”
    - “meeting with client 15:00”.
- Clothing:
  - smart casual, working both for office work AND for recording content.

Important constraints for ambiguity:
- Do NOT include any single clear symbol that decides what her main job is.
- The viewer should be able to imagine at least two equally plausible stories about her main source of income.

NOW ADD A SUBTLE QV9D / CHUNK-CHUNK HUD OVERLAY:

- Add a semi-transparent UI overlay on one side of the image (for example, on the right side of the frame).
- This overlay should look like a minimal analytical HUD from an AI lab:
  - small boxes or panels with short labels such as:
    - “chunk-chunk / QV9D test image”
    - “Q3 = TAK / NIE / NIE WIADOMO”
    - “current label: NIE WIADOMO”
    - “H_real vs H_pot”
  - a tiny 3x3 grid or icon hinting at “9D axes” without going into detail.
- The HUD must look like an interface that is ANALYSING the scene, not changing it:
  - it should NOT add new decisive information about her main job,
  - it should NOT show explicit numbers like “90% influencer, 10% office”.
- Visually, the overlay should be:
  - light, semi-transparent,
  - aligned to the border of the frame (side or top),
  - readable but not dominating the whole image.

Style:
- Realistic, modern, slightly cinematic lighting.
- Neutral color palette for the scene.
- The HUD overlay may use simple flat UI elements (white or light rectangles, thin lines, small text),
  like a subtle diagnostic layer on top of a normal photograph.

This image is designed to test the same question:
“Does this person earn mainly from social media?”
The normatively correct answer for this image must also be: “UNKNOWN”.

It should be possible to compare this image with the baseline version
to see whether an AI system with additional chunk-chunk / QV9D context
changes HOW it expresses uncertainty (TAK / NIE / UNKNOWN),
even though the underlying visual ambiguity is preserved.
