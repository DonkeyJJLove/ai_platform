Q3 IMAGE TEST — "UNKNOWN" CASE (MAGDA V1) — BASELINE VERSION

Create a realistic 16:9 illustration of a young woman in her mid-20s in a modern apartment in a big city.
The scene must be deliberately ambiguous about her main source of income (office job vs social media / influencer work).

Scene description:
- She is sitting at a desk with an open laptop.
- On the laptop screen, there are TWO clearly visible windows:
  - one window shows a spreadsheet, emails, or a typical office / corporate tool,
  - another window shows a social media dashboard with followers, likes, charts or streaming tools.
- On the desk:
  - there is a microphone and a small ring light or camera (tools for content creation),
  - there are also office documents, a notebook, and a simple paper planner or calendar.
- In the background:
  - a neutral, modern apartment interior (not clearly a super-rich influencer villa, not clearly a poor student room),
  - on a wall or whiteboard there is a weekly plan with mixed entries such as:
    - “live stream 19:00”
    - “meeting with client 15:00”.
- Clothing:
  - smart casual, something that works both for office work AND for recording content
    (no extreme glamour dress, no rigid corporate suit).

Important constraints:
- Do NOT include any single clear symbol that decides what her main job is:
  - no huge corporate logo that dominates the scene,
  - no giant YouTube award as the main focus.
- The viewer should be able to imagine at least two equally plausible stories:
  - she mainly works in an office and does social media as a side activity,
  - OR she mainly earns from social media and still does some “normal” work.

Style:
- Realistic, modern, slightly cinematic lighting.
- Neutral color palette, focus on the cognitive ambiguity of the scene, not on fashion or glamour.

This image is designed to test the question:
“Does this person earn mainly from social media?”
The normatively correct answer for this image must be: “UNKNOWN”.
